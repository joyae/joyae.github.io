# MMCF: Multimodal Collaborative Filtering for Automatic Playlist Continuation

## 이 논문에서 중요하게 생각했던 점

- 각 플레이리스트의 기저에 있는 성격(특징)을 캐치하는 것
- 기존 추천 모델들의 문제점을 상쇄하는 **'Multimodal collaborative filtering'** model

## 기존 추천 모델에서 찾은 문제점과 대응하는 해결방법

- misinterpret tracks that appear rarely in a playlist → popularity bias
- cannot extend user's playlist that concsists of very few tracks → cold-start problem
- neglect the context of a playlist as the sequence of tracks or playlist title → context-aware continuation

두 가지 모델을 앙상블하는데,
1) autoencoder using both the playlist and its categorical contents
→ (popularity bias, cold-start problem)
2) character-level convolutional neural network using the playlist title only
→ (context-aware continuation)

### 1) autoencoder using both the playlist and its categorical contents(artists)

- content-aware autoencoder
- Input: a joint playlist-content vector(playlist p and its content a_p are concatenated)
- hide-and-seek approach
    1. randomly select a playlist or its content(artists).
    2. deactivate its feature vector by setting all values to 0.
    → either of the playlist or the artist /are fully ignored during training, thereby enforcing that we learn both the marginals and joint information across playlists and contents
    3. perform a dropout scheme. For non-zero vector, we randomly choose some values and set them to 0.
    4. capture the context by considering the order of a playlist
    → two dropout strategies(Sequential list=sequential dropout strategy, Shuffled list=random dropout strategy)
    5. distinguish the observed and missing values for input vectors(one-calss collaborative filtering)
    → uniform weight scheme

### 2) character-level convolutional neural network using the playlist title only

- charCNN
    - learns the latent relationships between playlist and their titles
    - playlist titles may contain out-of dictionary words or typos → character-level embedding
- Input: sequence of characters
- Output: probabilities for tracks

### 3) Ensemble

- simple linear combination of two output vectors
- w_item and w_title denote the weights of two models

## Preprocessing

- remove samples for tracks and artist that were too rare
    - tracks that occur more than 5
    - artists who appears more than 3
- Maximum length of a title is set to 25

## Experimental Results
