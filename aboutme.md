Hi, there! My name is Yaelin Jo, a data scientist studying at Yonsei University.


### My philosophy

During my undergraduate years, I studied Business(or Business Administration) for my bachelor's degree.
The most important thing I learned from that time was that **the business is a sum of choices**.
Choices can be made based on someone's intuition, society's tradition or accumulated experiences.
**However, I believe the data is the start of decision-making**.

As time goes, this society transforms and gets more and more complicated.
To get a clear and deep understanding of this new complicated situation for business, we need to read data.

### My interests

My interest is in **Recommender System** and **Natural Language Processing**.

Since more varied products and services come out on market, and much easier to reach them via online,
We(especially me) are getting tired of making tons of choices in our dailylives.
For that, **Recommender System** can be a strong tool for us and even for the company.

And **Natural Language Processing** is important, because the data isn't just numbers.
It can be the news, our reviews about products or our online comments.
Dealing these texts(unstructured data) with NLP techniques is needed and must be based.
